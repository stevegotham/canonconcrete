	    	<h1>Canon Concrete Contractors, Inc.</h1>
	        <p>Mike and Elaine Haines established Canon Concrete Contractors, Inc. 18 years ago in
	        Fremont County. Canon Concrete Contractors specializes in custom stamped concrete, all flatwork,
	        monolithic slabs, concrete paving, curb & gutters, and foundations. They have completed

	        <p>As accredited members of the Better Business Bureau, Mike and Elaine have 40 years of
	        experience in concrete. They moved to Colorado Springs, Colorado in 1981 from Chicago, Illinois.
	        They started their business in Colorado Springs and were involved in numerous construction
	        projects, including Sam’s Club. In 1990 eager to raise their family in a smaller community, Mike
	        and Elaine moved to Penrose with their daughter Kristie and son Mike.</p>
	        <p>Through their children, Mike and Elaine became very involved in the community and have
	        been frequent supporters of youth and community programs such as the Fremont County 4-H
	        Livestock Sale, Florence High School Wrestling and Football Programs, Penrose Apple Day,
	        Belvedere Blue’s Festival, Orchard of Hope, Loaves and Fishes, Canon City Clock Tower and
	        Create Canon City. Working from their home, Mike and Elaine have kept Canon Concrete
	        Contractors a family business.</p>

	        movement, spalling (chipping and flaking) due to using de-icers and cracking caused by overweight
